# Deposit

The `deposit` instruction performs three main tasks:
- Deposit the `mint_x` and `mint_y` token based on the amount of LP the user wants to `mint`.
- Calculate the amount to deposit and check that the amount isn't greater than `max_x` and `max_y` designated by the user.
- Mint the right amount of `mint_lp` in the user ata.

> As mentioned in the `initialize` instruction section; we're going to initialize all the `Associated Token Accounts` outside of our instruction for optimization purposes.

<ArticleSection name="Required Accounts" id="required-accounts" level="h2" />

Below are the accounts required for this context:
- `user`: The user that is depositing the token into the liquidity of the Amm. Must be a `signer`.
- `mint_lp`: The Mint account that will represent the pool’s liquidity. Must be passed as `mutable`.
- `vault_x`: The token account that holds all of token X deposited into the pool. Must be passed as `mutable`.
- `vault_y`: The token account that holds all of token Y deposited into the pool. Must be passed as `mutable`.
- `user_x_ata`: The user's associated token account for token X. This is the source account from which the user's token X will be transferred into the pool. Must be passed as `mutable`.
- `user_y_ata`: The user's associated token account for token Y. This is the source account from which the user's token Y will be transferred into the pool. Must be passed as `mutable`.
- `user_lp_ata`: The user's associated token account for LP tokens. This is the destination account where LP tokens will be minted. Must be passed as `mutable`.
- `config`: The configuration account for the AMM pool. Stores all relevant pool parameters and state.
- `token program`: The SPL Token program account. This is required to perform token operations such as transfers and minting. Must be `executable`.

Here, again, I’ll leave the implementation to you:

```rust
pub struct DepositAccounts<'a> {
    pub user: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub mint_lp: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub vault_x: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub vault_y: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub user_x_ata: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub user_y_ata: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub user_lp_ata: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub config: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub token_program: &'a AccountInfo,
}

impl<'a> TryFrom<&'a [AccountInfo]> for DepositAccounts<'a> {
  type Error = ProgramError;

  fn try_from(accounts: &'a [AccountInfo]) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
    //..
  }
}
```

<ArticleSection name="Instruction Data" id="instruction-data" level="h2" />

Here's the instruction data we need to pass in:
- `amount`: The amount of LP token that the user wishes to receive. Must be a `[u64]`
- `max_x`: The max amount of token X that the user is willing to deposit. Must be a `[u64]`
- `max_y`: The max amount of token Y that the user is willing to deposit. Must be a `[u64]`
- `expiration`: The expiration of this order. Important to make sure that the transaction has to be played in a certain amount of time. Must be a `[i64]`

We're going to handle the implementation for the `DepositInstructionData` same as initialization. So I’ll leave the implementation to you:

```rust
pub struct DepositInstructionData {
    pub amount: u64,
    pub max_x: u64,
    pub max_y: u64,
    pub expiration: i64,
}

impl<'a> TryFrom<&'a [u8]> for DepositInstructionData {
    type Error = ProgramError;

    fn try_from(data: &'a [u8]) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        //..
    }
}
```

> Make sure that any of the amount, like `amount`, `max_y` and `max_x` are greater than zero and that the order has not expired yet using the `Clock` sysvar.

<ArticleSection name="Instruction Logic" id="instruction-logic" level="h2" />

We begin by deserializing both the `instruction_data` and the `accounts`.

We then need to:
- Load the `Config` account to grab all the data inside of it. We can do so using the `Config::load()` helper.
- Verify that the `AmmState` is valid (so if it's equal to `AmmState::Initialized`)
- Check the derivation of `vault_x` and `vault_y` to be Associated Token Accounts like this:
```rust
// Check if the vault_x is valid
let (vault_x, _) = find_program_address(
    &[
        self.accounts.config.key(),
        self.accounts.token_program.key(),
        config.mint_x(),
    ],
    &pinocchio_associated_token_account::ID,
);

if vault_x.ne(self.accounts.vault_x.key()) {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData);
}
```
- Deserialize all the token accounts involved and use the data inside of them to calculate the amount to deposits using the `constant-product-curve` crate and checking for slippage like this:
```rust
// Deserialize the token accounts
let mint_lp = unsafe { Mint::from_account_info_unchecked(self.accounts.mint_lp)? };
let vault_x = unsafe { TokenAccount::from_account_info_unchecked(self.accounts.vault_x)? };
let vault_y = unsafe { TokenAccount::from_account_info_unchecked(self.accounts.vault_y)? };

// Grab the amounts to deposit
let (x, y) = match mint_lp.supply() == 0 && vault_x.amount() == 0 && vault_y.amount() == 0 {
    true => (self.instruction_data.max_x, self.instruction_data.max_y),
    false => {
        let amounts = ConstantProduct::xy_deposit_amounts_from_l(
            vault_x.amount(),
            vault_y.amount(),
            mint_lp.supply(),
            self.instruction_data.amount,
            6,
        )
        .map_err(|_| ProgramError::InvalidArgument)?;

        (amounts.x, amounts.y)
    }
};

// Check for slippage
if !(x <= self.instruction_data.max_x && y <= self.instruction_data.max_y) {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
}
```

> If it's the first deposit, we can skip the calculation of LP tokens and deposits and just go with the value that the user suggest

- Transfer the amounts from the token accounts of the user to the vaults and mint the appropriate amount of LP tokens to the user token account

You should be proficient enough to this on your own, so I’ll leave the implementation to you:

```rust
pub struct Deposit<'a> {
    pub accounts: DepositAccounts<'a>,
    pub instruction_data: DepositInstructionData,
}

impl<'a> TryFrom<(&'a [u8], &'a [AccountInfo])> for Deposit<'a> {
    type Error = ProgramError;

    fn try_from((data, accounts): (&'a [u8], &'a [AccountInfo])) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        let accounts = DepositAccounts::try_from(accounts)?;
        let instruction_data = DepositInstructionData::try_from(data)?;

        // Return the initialized struct
        Ok(Self {
            accounts,
            instruction_data,
        })
    }
}

impl<'a> Deposit<'a> {
    pub const DISCRIMINATOR: &'a u8 = &1;

    pub fn process(&mut self) -> ProgramResult {
      //..

      Ok(())
    }
}
```
