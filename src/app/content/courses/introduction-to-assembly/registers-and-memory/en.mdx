# sBPF Registers and Memory Model

When your sBPF program executes, it operates with two primary storage mechanisms: 11 high-speed registers built into the processor and organized memory regions that hold everything else.

<ArticleSection name="Registers" id="registers" level="h2" />

Registers are like 11 numbered storage slots (`r0` through `r10`) built directly into the processor. Each holds a single 64-bit value and provides instant access without delays. When you execute `add64 r1, r2`, the processor immediately retrieves values from both registers and performs the calculation.

The tradeoff is simple: you only get 11 boxes total, so you need to use them strategically for the values you're actively working with.

sBPF assigns specific roles to each register:

| Register | Role                 | Callee-saved?  | Usage Notes                                 |
|----------|----------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `r0`     | Return value         | No             | Function results, syscall return values     |
| `r1`     | Input buffer pointer | No             | Points to 0x400000000 on entry              |
| `r2-r5`  | Scratch/arguments    | No             | Helper function arguments, temporary values |
| `r6-r9`  | General purpose      | Yes            | Must preserve across calls                  |
| `r10`    | Frame pointer        | Yes, read-only | Stack base, cannot modify directly          |

Registers `r6` through `r9` are "callee-saved," meaning their values persist across function calls. Use these for important data that must survive function invocations. 

The remaining registers (`r0`-`r5`) get overwritten during syscalls and function calls.

Register `r10` is "special" because it serves as your frame pointer, pointing to your stack space base and remaining read-only. You access stack variables using negative offsets like `[r10 - 8]` and `[r10 - 16]`.

<ArticleSection name="Memory" id="memory" level="h2" />

While registers hold actively used values, memory stores everything else. sBPF organizes memory into fixed regions with identical layouts across all programs:

| Region | Start Address | Purpose                 | Size/Notes             |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Text   | 0x100000000   | Code and read-only data | Program binary         |
| Stack  | 0x200000000   | Local variables         | 32 KiB, grows downward |
| Heap   | 0x300000000   | Dynamic allocation      | Via `sol_alloc_free`   |
| Input  | 0x400000000   | Program parameters      | Serialized arguments   |

- The **text region** contains your executable code and read-only data like string constants. Data defined with `.quad` directives typically resides here.
- The **stack region** houses local variables. With `r10` pointing to the stack base, you access locals using negative offsets: `[r10 - 16]`, `[r10 - 24]`, etc. The stack is limited to 32 KiB total.
- The **input region** contains your program's parameters. On entry, `r1` points to this region (`0x400000000`), allowing you to read serialized account data and instruction parameters passed to your program.

This fixed layout provides three key benefits: security through memory isolation between programs, determinism with identical addresses across all validators, and performance through compiler optimizations for known locations.

Here's how registers and memory work together in practice:

```assembly
.globl entrypoint
entrypoint:
    # On entry: r1 points to input data at 0x400000000
    
    ldxdw r0, [r1 + 0]      # Load first 8 bytes from input into r0
    mov64 r2, 42            # Put 42 in register r2
    add64 r0, r2            # Add them: r0 = r0 + r2
    
    stxdw [r10 - 8], r0     # Store result on stack
    mov64 r0, 0             # Return success
    exit
```

This program demonstrates the typical pattern:
- Uses register `r1` (input pointer) to read from memory
- Uses registers `r0` and `r2` for calculations
- Uses register `r10` (frame pointer) to access stack memory
- Returns the result in register `r0`

The workflow follows a consistent pattern: load data from memory into registers, perform calculations with registers, then store results back to memory when needed.

### Stack Usage

The stack operates with `r10` as the frame pointer, pointing to the base of your current stack frame (the highest address). Local variables use negative offsets:

```assembly
# Store a value on the stack
mov64 r0, 42
stxdw [r10 - 8], r0         ; Store at first stack slot

# Load it back
ldxdw r1, [r10 - 8]         ; Load from first stack slot
```

Stack slots are typically 8 bytes wide, so consecutive variables use offsets like `[r10 - 8]`, `[r10 - 16]`, `[r10 - 24]`, and so on.

### Program Entry and Exit

Your program begins execution at the symbol marked with `.globl` (typically entrypoint). The initial register state is minimal and predictable:

```assembly
.globl entrypoint
entrypoint:
    # On entry:
    # r1 = 0x400000000 (input buffer pointer)
    # r0, r2-r10 = 0 (all other registers zeroed)

    # Your program logic here

    mov64 r0, 0     # Success code (0 = SUCCESS)
    exit            # Return to runtime
```

Exit behavior depends on call depth:
- At call depth 0, exit terminates the program with `r0` as the result code. 
- At deeper call levels, exit acts like a return statement, restoring caller-saved registers (`r6`-`r9`) and the caller's frame pointer (`r10`) before continuing execution at the return address.

The runtime automatically handles setup and teardown through implicit prologue and epilogue code, including initial register state configuration and final return processing.
