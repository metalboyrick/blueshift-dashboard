# Tooling

Writing and building sBPF Assembly programs traditionally required the full Solana toolchain, which can be complex to set up and platform-dependent. For this exact reason, [Dean](https://x.com/deanmlittle), with contribution from [Claire](https://x.com/clairefxyz), created sBPF: a complete toolkit for creating and building sBPF Assembly programs with two build options to suit different needs.

<ArticleSection name="Installation" id="installation" level="h2" />

We start by installing the package by doing:

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/blueshift-gg/sbpf.git
```

After that we'll be able to do all the following commands:
- `init`: Create a new project scaffold.
- `build`: Compile into a Solana program executable.
- `deploy`: Build and deploy the program.
- `test`: Test the deployed program.
- `e2e`: Build, deploy, and test a program.
- `clean`: Clean up build and deploy artifacts.
- `help`: Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s).

```
Usage: sbpf <COMMAND>

Commands:
  init    Create a new project scaffold
  build   Compile into a Solana program executable
  deploy  Build and deploy the program
  test    Test deployed program
  e2e     Build, deploy and test a program
  clean   Clean up build and deploy artifacts
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

<ArticleSection name="Initialize a new project" id="initialize-a-new-project" level="h2" />

To create a new project, use the `sbpf init` command. By default, it initializes a project with Rust tests using Mollusk. You can also initialize a project with TypeScript tests using the `--ts-tests` option.

```
sbpf init --help
Create a new project scaffold

Usage: sbpf init [OPTIONS] [NAME]

Arguments:
  [NAME]  The name of the project to create

Options:
  -t, --ts-tests  Initialize with TypeScript tests instead of Mollusk Rust tests
  -h, --help      Print help information
  -V, --version   Print version information
```

After initializing the project, you can navigate into the project directory and use other commands to build, deploy, and test your program.

<ArticleSection name="Building Programs" id="building-programs" level="h2" />

sBPF provides two build options depending on your setup and needs:

### Light Build (Raccomended)

The light-build command is a standalone assembler that requires no additional dependencies. It's perfect for learning and experimentation since it "just works" on any platform.

```
sbpf light-build
```

### Full Build

The standard build command provides integration with the complete Solana toolchain and project management features. 

> This requires the [Solana Command Line Tools](https://docs.anza.xyz/cli/install/) to be installed.

```
sbpf build
```

### Advanced Usage

You can override the default linker with a custom linker file by including it in the src directory with the same name as your program. For example:

```
src/example/example.s
src/example/example.ld
```

<ArticleSection name="Development Environment" id="development-environment" level="h2" />

For the best development experience, consider installing the [VS Code sBPF Assembly extension](https://github.com/deanmlittle/vscode-sbpf-asm) which provides:
- Syntax highlighting for sBPF assembly
- Code completion for instructions and registers
- Error detection and warnings
